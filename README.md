# Phansible

[Phansible](http://phansible.com) is a simple generator for Vagrant projects, targeting PHP development environments, using Ansible as Provisioner.

It was inspired by [PuPHPet](http://puphpet.com).

The project is built on top of [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/), using [Flint](http://flint.readthedocs.org/).
